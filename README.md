Code from the paper ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs Always a Bigger Fish: A Clarifying Analysis of a Machine-Learning-Assisted Side-Channel Attack‚Äù.

You can reach our paper through this [link](https://github.com/ranaislek/BiggerFish-Bachelors-Thesis/blob/main/Reports%20%26%20Paper/Loop_Attacks_on_GPUs.pdf).
 
 ## Abstract
A loop-counting attack increments the value of a counter during a short period of time, repeats the experiments multiple
times, and analyzes the sequence of counter values observed, which are affected by the system interrupts, to infer secret information
about a victim. These attacks have been so far leveraged for website fingerprinting. In this work, we show that the same attack can also
be used for GPU (graphics processing unit) application fingerprinting. More specifically, we demonstrate that the GPU applications
typically cause distinguishable patterns of interrupts between the GPU and the CPU, affecting the counter values, such that the
sequence of counter values can be analyzed to determine the application running on the GPU. In our experiments conducted on
various combinations of operating systems (OS), browsers, media players, and video codecs, we observed that the proposed approach
correctly predicted the media player running on the GPU with an average accuracy of 87.99% and the codec of the video being played
with an average accuracy of 62.92%

## Setup
Rana is here and Ali is happy.
### Install dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install our dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install browser drivers

You only need to install the drivers for the browsers you would like to use.

- Chrome: Download [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and add `chromedriver` to your path
- Firefox: Download [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) and add `geckodriver` to your path
- Safari: Skip this step! `safaridriver` is built into macOS
- [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org): Install [tor-browser-selenium](https://github.com/webfp/tor-browser-selenium)
- [Links](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_(web_browser)>): We didn‚Äôt keep any experiments with this text-based browser for the paper, but on macOS you can install it with `brew install links` and use our built-in driver

## Usage

Our recording script takes many command-line arguments, making a wide variety of experiments possible. Most experiments we ran in the paper should be covered here, and you can also create your own experiments by modifying the arguments or changing the attacker code in `attacker/worker.js`.

1. [Basic recording setup](https://github.com/jackcook/bigger-fish/wiki/Basic-recording-setup) (Table 1)
   1. [Adding countermeasures](https://github.com/jackcook/bigger-fish/wiki/Basic-recording-setup#adding-countermeasures) (Table 2)
   2. [Tor Browser experiments](https://github.com/jackcook/bigger-fish/wiki/Basic-recording-setup#using-older-versions-of-chrome)
   3. [Using older versions of Chrome](https://github.com/jackcook/bigger-fish/wiki/Basic-recording-setup#using-older-versions-of-chrome)
   4. [Setting up SMS notifications](https://github.com/jackcook/bigger-fish/wiki/Basic-recording-setup#setting-up-sms-notifications)
2. Isolation experiments (Table 3)
   1. Pin attacker and victim to separate cores
   2. Isolate interrupts from attacker core
3. eBPF analysis tool (Figure 5)
4. Changing timer parameters (Table 4)

## Evaluation

Once you‚Äôve collected some data, you‚Äôll want to train a model and test it to find its accuracy. For small experiments, we‚Äôve included a script, `check_results.py`, that trains a simple random forest model for a quick sanity check.

```bash
# Record 40 5-second traces of the top 4 websites according to Alexa, and
# save the traces to readme-experiment
$ python record_data.py --num_runs 40 --trace_length 5 --sites_list alexa4 --out_directory readme-experiment
...

# Load the traces and check accuracy
$ python scripts/check_results.py --data_file readme-experiment

top5 accuracy: 100.0% (+/- 0.0%)
```

For larger experiments, you‚Äôll want to train an LSTM, as we do in the paper. For ease of use, we‚Äôve included our training code in a Colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GRQwuxlfoCPaiM7BiP9giHS2sMppvYHH?usp=sharing.
